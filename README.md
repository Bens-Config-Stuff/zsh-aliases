# zsh-aliases
This repo contains my zsh-aliases.  
Since using [zsh](zsh.sourceforge.net) as my default shell, i use the plugin mangager [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/). I decided to create a custom plugin with my personal aliases.  
Following Oh-My-Zsh lead i created my private plugin in the `custom/plugins` folder.

## Installation
This repo is not part (yet) of the official plugin list, so you need to install it manually:
- `cd "$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins" && git@github.com:Bens-Config-Stuff/zsh-aliases.git bens-config-stuff`
- Edit your `~/.zshrc` and add `bens-config-stuff` to the list of plugins:
  `plugins=( ... bens-config-stuff )`
- It's best to close all terminal sessions and start a fresh one to use the aliases.  

NOTE: these aliases might overwrite some aliases you already installed with Oh-My-Zsh!

Have Fun :-)
